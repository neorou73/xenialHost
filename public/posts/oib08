Some notes on how to convert multiple files from one file extension to another, using basic PERL script. This is a living document - it will most definitely have edits later.


Consider the following perl script:



#!/usr/bin/perl
# this is a perl utility that takes a group of files and renames them using a new extension
# there are a few scenarios to consider:
#   1. we want to take all files with a given extension and simply remove the extension
#   2. we want to change the all files with the same extension and
use warnings;
use strict;

use File::Find;
my $mydir = $ARGV[0]; # directory to search
my $oext = $ARGV[1]; # old extension
my $next = $ARGV[2]; # new extension
my $f; # file iteration variable for array of myFiles returned
my $nf; # converted file iteration
my @myFiles;
my $lnOfCharsToRemove; # use this in the rename loop for when an old extension value is passed ($ARGV[1] ne 'none')

# run command to search for wanted files and push into mydir array
find(\&amp;Wanted, $mydir);

# create a subroutine that takes each file in this directory and rename them with new extension
sub Wanted {
  # return all files because no extension is given
    if ($oext eq "none") {
        (/.*/) or return;
          }
            else
              {
                  # return files with given extension only
                      (/\.$oext$/) or return;
                        }
                          push @myFiles, $File::Find::name;
                          }

                          # run a process for the array of myFiles
                          foreach $f (@myFiles) {
                            # make sure we are only dealing with files (-f is for files, -d is for directories)
                              if (-f $f) {
                                  # go through each of the above scenarios
                                      if ($oext eq "none" and $next ne "none")
                                          {
                                                # simply add the new extension to each of the found files
                                                      print "\textensionless file " . $f . " found, will add a \'." . $next . "\' extension\n";
                                                            rename($f, ($f . "." . $next));
                                                                }

                                                                        {

                                                                                    $lnOfCharsToRemove = length($oext) + 1; # adding one for the extra "."

                                                                                                                                                            I have been needing this utility now for I can not remember how long.
                                                                                                                                                            The next phase in this development involves using multiple directories.
