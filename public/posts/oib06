Really, the first philosophy in knowing when to use either one languages seems to boil down to this:


    Perl allows a lot of flexibility in terms of how you want to tell your machine to do a particular task. TMTOWTDI (There Is More Than One Way To Do It).
        Python on the other hand, recommends a specific way to do a particular task.TSOBOWTDI (There Should Only Be One Way To Do It).

        Either one though, has a whole slew of extensions and components that you can use to accomplish pretty much anything.


        Advanced (and not so advanced) experts probably have their own takes on the matter, but this approach has been rewarding for this note taker thus far.
